## Readme

Hey, what's up. I'm Dennis and I'm a self-taught web dev, but I've mainly stuck to making custom wordpress sites and simple JS programs. I really liked wordle and when I saw what NYT bought em I said fuck it, Imma make my own version of wordle as a test project for me to experiment with coding custom apps. 

Thanks for riding along and feel free to contribute!
